# Sort List Challenge

## Description

The challenge is simple, write an algorithm to sort a list of numerical values, using any programming language you want.
The use of functions such as `sort()` in python,... are not allowed, you need to write the algorithm from scratch.
The list can be sorted in the ascendent or the descendent order.

##  Tasks:

1. Write your algorithm in any programming language you want 
2. Add the file you created into this directory
3. The name of the file should be your_name.file_type, example: `abdelahk_aissat.py`.
- If you use more then one file then name them in a directory with the same naming convention.
Example:
 Let's suppose you created 2 files: `sort1.rs` and `sort2.rs` you need to create a folder named `your_name`(abdelhak_aissat for example)
 and put them inside of it.
