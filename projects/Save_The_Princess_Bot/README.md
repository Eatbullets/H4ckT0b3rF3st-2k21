## Project description

A Princess is trapped in one of the four corners of a square grid. You are located in the center of this grid and you can only make one move at a time in one of the four directions of your choice. Can you save the Princess using the shortest past possible ?

## Your Task

In this project, we already created a simple path finding method using euclidian distance. Your goal is to create a more optimal function with a better complexity. the grid is 5x5 length, the position of the princess is in the Princess variable and the knight position is the Knight variable. Your function has to return a list of the x and y indexes of the cases of the grid of the grid that the knight passed throught to save the princess.  

## Requirements

Before starting 🏁, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

## Starting

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone

# Access
$ cd Save_The_Princess_Bot

#go to the SaveThePrincess.py file and copy past the YourFunction() function change it's name and start creating your funcion.

```

```Python
#After finishing your function replace FindThePath by the name of your Function

start(i,FindThePath()) ===> start(i,YourFunction())

#Compile and see the result

```
